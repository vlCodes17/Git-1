Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! 

Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've Learned Today
1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts

2. **Git Hub x Netlify**: I created my first GitHub repository and learned how to commit changes, as well as linking the deployed netlify site to reflect my commits, big day!

3. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder. 

4. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post!  I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts! This is also the very first time I am seeing/using  Markdown!


## What's Next
I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts to document my programing journey.  Watch this space for more to come!
